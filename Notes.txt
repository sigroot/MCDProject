						DOC - A:
Components likely won't change
"Supervisor reset chip"
Remember caps test points etc.
In class: Free samples are not worth it
Daisy chain only works on low frequency
Use Power LEDs
Bus on power
Minimize high frequency traces
Keep decoupling caps close
CPU pin A1 is the first to go to R(O/A)M A0
Run R(O/A)M CE/CS separate to CPLD
Power plane is a thing, but more difficult (Can have capacitance)
Use recommended parts
Check parts have clear PCB footprints
Typos are very possible
Use sockets (eg zip) - 3M are high-quality
Use DIP and PLCC over SMD
Test pins should be > 1cm long
Clock must be within CPU rate
Resistors or CPLD for unused CPU inputs (eg 4.7kOhm)
Resistors not needed for output/power pins
10uF cap for power supply input/output
1uF/0.1uF capf or bypass cap on chips. (One input with power pin on chip and other input should be ground)
Can research cap values
Reset circuit for CPU, not DUART

Common mistakes:
	halt/reset lines should be high volt until button is pressed
	square chips flipped/rotated
	solder continuity
	Test pin spacing too small
	Some PLCC datasheet numbering is incorrect
	LEDs should be R/G with 330 Ohm resistors
	See digikey/mouser
	
Schematic:
	Address, data, power are most chips that need to be wired together between chips. All else needs to be separate (some exceptions)
	CPLD does not need data bus
	check clock is attacked to cpld
	Test pins for clock, halt/reset, address bus, function code, address/data strobes, DTACK*, BERR*, etc.
	Use all pins on CPLD to permit software fixes
	DOUBLE CHECK SCHEMATICS TO DATASHEETS.
	When checking address bus, ensure AS is low
	Do not forget pins routed to CPLD to be set high/low (eg interrupt controls)
	Set logic on ram chips so processor doesn't accidently write to it.
	implement LDS/UDS

PCB:
	READ DATASHEETS (Often recommended land pattern)
	study/practice pinnouts before starting
	CPLD & MPU likely in middle of board
	Be careful with PLCC pinnouts. DONT ASSUME
	check pin sizes (especially with ZIF sockets and TO parts like voltage regulators)
	Check orrientation, especially DSUB
	Recommend 2 layer, < 60 in^2

Programming:
	Easy68k does not do word/byte mores correctly
	use input/output routines from monitor program in book (may need modifying)
	S-Records are easier with byte writes to RAM (only possible if  CS/CE of RAM is connected separately)

CHECK COMMON MISTAKES AND FAQ
	Stack work, chip addressing, monitor program, DUART
	EEPROM/S-RAM OE pin, DUART/UART control/communication, BERR use, buses, GSR, Supervisors ship, max 232/233, cap bias, 
	
	Family of CPU/CPLD/UART is good enough, check op voltage of chip, Resistors: LED, pullup/down, voltage reg, Capacitors: Vin decoupling, voltage reg, RS232 specification
